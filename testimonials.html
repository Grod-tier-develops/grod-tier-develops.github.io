						<span class="dropcap">Y</span>ou are such a great instructor.  I hope those folks know how lucky they are to have someone with your talents and skills instructing them!

						<span class="dropcap">Y</span>ou are so qualified and talented teacher and a terrific salsa inspiration!!    
						<BLOCKQUOTE>
						~ Vicki Nakamura
						</BLOCKQUOTE>
						<span class="dropcap">I</span>'ve been to Cheryl Burke's and with 3 different instructors at Palomar in Santa Cruz and you are by far the best. I really like your emphasis on getting the moves and the motion correct, rather than just teaching pattern after pattern which as you correctly pointed out, we just forget anyway.    
						<BLOCKQUOTE>
						~ Jim Allen
						</BLOCKQUOTE>
						<span class="dropcap">Y</span>ou are by far the most instructional teacher I've come across in the past year. The manner in which you explain the particulars of the steps helped me immensely. "Now I get it" is what I consistently told myself last evening. Again, awesome class! 
						<BLOCKQUOTE>

						<span class="dropcap">I</span> sat in on your Fri. night class at the Lafayette Comm. and thought your teaching style was terrific.
						<BLOCKQUOTE>
						~ Ellen
						</BLOCKQUOTE>
						<span class="dropcap">I</span>'ve seen people drive from all over the Bay Area just to attend Tomaj's classes.  This teacher is fantastic and his classes are the best I've attended.  No matter what your expertise, no matter your age, no matter how many levels (beginning/intermediate/advanced) in attendance, Tomaj can work with ALL, and everyone feels good and knows more at the end of the hour.  And they sign up time and again!  Tomaj is The Best.    
						<BLOCKQUOTE>
						~ Nancy Lockhart, San Ramon
						</BLOCKQUOTE>
						<span class="dropcap">W</span>hile vacationing for one week in San Francisco, my daughter and I signed up for every possible Salsa class in the city over a one week period, for a total of 28 hours of lessons, with multiple teachers.   Tomaj's instruction was by far the most professional and fun.
						<BLOCKQUOTE>
						~ Debby from Vermont
						</BLOCKQUOTE>
						<span class="dropcap">T</span>hrough taking both private and group lessons with Tomaj, I've come to see that his teaching style is, itself, like a dance.  His understanding of psychology, which I've seen him apply in private coaching sessions, coupled with his obvious caring for his students, which I've seen him express in his group class settings, makes him an exceptionally good dance instructor.  He knows when being encouraging is more important than being challenging, can sense when I am "on" and can be pushed, as well as when I am  not and need to be nurtured.  In this 'dance' in which Tomaj has pressed me forward and backed off, even turned a serious mood around with some levity, and helped me 'get serious' when I couldn't stop laughing--all depending on where he has sensed that I am in terms of enthusiasm, skill, or concentration, on a given day--I've been able to develop my skills and technique at a surprising rate without losing the primary goal of why I came--to experience the absolute thrill, joy, and, of course, passion of salsa music and dance.

						<span class="dropcap">T</span>omaj is a master teacher.  He is the most patient and thorough dance teacher either of us have ever had.  He has a lively style that make his classes very mentally and physically invigorating.  We're impressed with his ability to teach to different levels at the same time:  he is very patient with beginning steps, yet incorporates advanced techniques that keep all levels of students interested.  We are simply thrilled to be in his class.
						<BLOCKQUOTE>
						~ Patricia and Edward Dill
						</BLOCKQUOTE>
						<span class="dropcap">Y</span>our teaching style is superior to the other teacher's I have studied with because it is more thorough, progressive and FUN.  The pace is just right and you break everything down so that I learn the moves completely.
						<BLOCKQUOTE>
						~ Karen, Lafayette
						</BLOCKQUOTE>
						<span class="dropcap">T</span>omaj teaches with "high energy" and provides excellent group management and individual attention.  He takes the time to field questions from students and offers clear answers to those questions.  Mr. Trenda has enthusiasm, clarity and organization and students very much appreciate his teaching style.  The way he teaches is positive and effective.

						~ Ron Gaiz, Dean of Arts and Humanities, College of Marin
						</BLOCKQUOTE>
						<span class="dropcap">A</span>s a math teacher, I have a good appreciation for someone who is a good teacher.  I can tell that Tomaj has the gift for teaching. His approach for beginners is one of steady, patient progression, allowing each step learned to build toward something else.  He truly wants each and every person to learn the steps and seems to intuitively know when someone is struggling and is able to zero in on what is preventing them from nailing down a step. I am so pleased to have discovered Tomaj. His methodical approach to teaching salsa is giving me new confidence, and I can see how this can be fun!  I am now a raving fan of Tomaj's. He is a gifted teacher who's genuine enthusiasm is infectious.
